# ubuntusshd
his Docker image provides an Ubuntu 24.04 base with SSH server enabled. It allows you to easily create SSH-accessible containers via SSH keys or with a default username and password.

Usage
Cloning the Repository
To get started, clone the GitHub repository containing the Dockerfile and scripts:

git clone https://github.com/tracynlcode/ubuntusshd
cd ubuntu-sshd


Building the Docker Image
Build the Docker image from within the cloned repository directory:

docker build -t my-ubuntu-sshd:latest .
Running a Container
To run a container based on the image, use the following command:

docker run -d \
  -p host-port:22 \
  -e SSH_USERNAME=myuser \
  -e SSH_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -e AUTHORIZED_KEYS="$(cat path/to/authorized_keys_file)" \
  -e SSHD_CONFIG_ADDITIONAL="your_additional_config" \
  -e SSHD_CONFIG_FILE="/path/to/your/sshd_config_file" \
  my-ubuntu-sshd:latest
  
-d runs the container in detached mode.

-p host-port:22 maps a host port to port 22 in the container. Replace host-port with your desired port.

-e SSH_USERNAME=myuser sets the SSH username in the container. Replace myuser with your desired username.

-e SSH_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword sets the SSH user's password in the container. 
   This environment variable is required. Replace mysecretpassword with your desired password.
   
-e AUTHORIZED_KEYS="$(cat path/to/authorized_keys_file)" sets authorized SSH keys in the container. 
   Replace path/to/authorized_keys_file with the path to your authorized_keys file.
-e SSHD_CONFIG_ADDITIONAL="your_additional_config" allows you to pass additional SSHD configuration. 
   Replace your_additional_config with your desired configuration.
-e SSHD_CONFIG_FILE="/path/to/your/sshd_config_file" allows you to specify a file containing additional SSHD configuration. 
   Replace /path/to/your/sshd_config_file with the path to your configuration file.
my-ubuntu-sshd:latest should be replaced with your Docker image's name and tag.

SSH Access
Once the container is running, you can SSH into it using the following command:

ssh -p host-port myuser@localhost

host-port should match the port you specified when running the container.
Use the provided password or SSH key for authentication, depending on your configuration.
Note
If the AUTHORIZED_KEYS environment variable is empty when starting the container, it will still launch the SSH server, but no authorized keys will be configured. You have to mount your own authorized keys file or manually configure the keys in the container.
If AUTHORIZED_KEYS is provided, password authentication will be disabled for enhanced security.
